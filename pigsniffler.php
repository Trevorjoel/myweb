						<p>"Is the President a nigger?" replied Joe to Cleetus's offer of
							another beer the pair chuckled. Cleetus pulled his wiry frame out
							of the chair to fetch another beer. As the putrid stench of pig
							shit wafted from the pig farm through the Mid-Western evening air
							into the rundown homestead. "Things ain't' been the same 'round
							here Joe since we contracted our farm out to Monsanto," Cleetus
							started. "Yeh, how so," replied Joe, obliging the invitation to
							hear what's on his mind. "Well y' know, since we been feedin'
							them pigs that special grain they make us feed 'em they been
							actin' all funny," said Cleetus, before he tipped up his can high
							and chugged back a large portion of his Beer. Joe laughed, "What
							the hell you talkin' 'bout Cleetus?" "Well, the little
							sons-of-bitches seem agitated, an' gettin' a lot smarter also
							Gramps' tol' me that when he was feeding old Baconius Maximus he
							looked at him as though he had murder in his eyes." Joe lifted
							his John Deere cap and scratched his head with the brim. "Hell
							your Pa's gettin' long in the tooth, ya' don't think he's goin' a
							bit crazy?" Cleetus's shot back, "Naw', the old coot's pushin' 90
							an' sharp as a tack." The pair paused in quiet reflection
							drinking beer and looking out from the front porch over the dusty
							evening horizon. Soon in the distance, the two old pals noticed a
							pickup truck billowing dust behind it as it sped up the long
							driveway.</p> <footer> </footer>

		<p>Mary, Cleetus's daughter, kissed the driver on the cheek and got
			out of the truck. Mary was a real country girl a Dasy Duke if you
			will. Often Mary was wearing high cut jeans shorts with pockets
			showing past the leg holes, cheekily showing the crescent shape that
			gloriously delineates where leg meets buttock. To add to Cleetus's
			fatherly woes Mary was a fan of wearing flannel shirts tied at the
			mid rift in such a fashion as to function as a push-up bra for her
			already ample bust and to show as much of her well-defined torso.
			"Out whorin' again?", Cleetus asked rhetorically as she approached
			the front porch. "Out here again drinkin' with Joe Pa'?", she said
			defiantly, "Anyways, Teddy's a good 'un"</p>
