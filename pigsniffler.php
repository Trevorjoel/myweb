  <p>"Is the President a nigger?" replied Joe to Cleetus's offer of another beer the pair chuckled. Cleetus pulled his wiry frame out of the chair to fetch another beer. As the putrid stench of pig shit wafted from the pig farm through the Mid-Western evening air into the rundown homestead.  "Things ain't' been the same 'round here Joe since we contracted our farm out to Monsanto," Cleetus started. 
"Yeh, how so," replied Joe, obliging the invitation to hear what's on his mind.
"Well y' know, since we been feedin' them pigs that special grain they make us feed 'em they been actin' all funny," said Cleetus, before he tipped up his can high and chugged back a large portion of his Beer.
Joe laughed, "What the hell you talkin' 'bout Cleetus?" "Well, the little sons-of-bitches seem agitated, an' gettin' a lot smarter also Gramps' tol' me that when he was feeding old Baconius Maximus he looked at him as though he had murder in his eyes."
Joe lifted his  John Deere cap and scratched his head with the brim. "Hell your Pa's gettin' long in the tooth, ya' don't think he's goin' a bit crazy?"
Cleetus's shot back, "Naw', the old coot's pushin' 90 an' sharp as a tack." 
The pair paused in quiet reflection drinking beer and looking out from the front porch over the dusty evening horizon. Soon in the distance, the two old pals noticed a pickup truck billowing dust behind it as it sped up the long driveway. </p>

<p>Update: #2. Mary-Lou</p>
<p>Mary, Cleetus's daughter, kissed the driver on the cheek and got out of the truck. Mary was a real country girl a Dasy Duke if you will. 
Often Mary was wearing high cut jeans shorts with pockets showing past the leg holes, cheekily showing the crescent shape that gloriously delineates where leg meets buttock. To add to Cleetus's fatherly woes Mary was a fan of wearing flannel shirts tied at the mid rift in such a fashion as to function as a push-up bra for her already ample bust and to show as much of her well-defined torso.  
"Out whorin' again?", Cleetus asked rhetorically as she approached the front porch.
"Out here again drinkin' with Joe Pa'?", she said defiantly, "Anyways, Teddy's a good 'un"</p>
