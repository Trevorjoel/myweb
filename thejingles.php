			<b>Name:<br>The Jingles<br> Location:<br> Tallin, Estonia
			</b>
		</p>

		<p>This great four piece band out of Estonia are long time friends of
			mine.</p>
		<p>They consist of; Jonathan flack on guitars and vocals, Rauno Vaher
			on percussion, Hainn Hoppe on guitars and Tanel Liberg on bass guitar
			with all members on the vibes.</p>
		<p>Their style is an eclectic throwback to simpler times when music
			was played for love, not vanity or riches. Their sets consist of
			unique, upbeat renditions of popular songs and old classics, with
			well written and rapidly developing originals being continually added
			to the set list. It's the type of show than can pull you out of a
			troubled state of mind and get you smiling and dancing the night
			away.</p>
		<p>They are headed up by Jonathan from Melbourne Australia, who
			infuses the band with a great philosophy and work ethic. Jonathan has
			been blessed with a great group of like-minded musicians who are all
			accomplished in their art. The jingles are great bunch of guys who
			all contribute to the songwriting process, and stage presence.</p>
		<p>Spending a lot of time hanging out with them, watching them
			rehearse, perform and get better I would bet they are going somewhere
			soon.</p>
		<p>They are presently in the competition for Estonian Eurovision and
			you can support them with that. You should really check them out if
			you get the chance, I can personally vouch for them.</p>
		<p>Here's the latest video of them:</p>

			to like and share) to keep up to date on gigs, new material or to buy
			their new album.</p>
