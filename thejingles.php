		<p>This great four piece band out of Estonia are long time friends of
			mine.</p>
		<p>They consist of; Jonathan flack on guitars and vocals, Rauno Vaher
			on percussion, Hainn Hoppe on guitars and Tanel Liberg on bass guitar
			with all members on the vibes.</p>
		<p>Their style is an eclectic throwback to simpler times when music
			was played for love, not vanity or riches. <br>Their sets consist of
			unique, upbeat renditions of popular songs and old classics, with
			well written and rapidly developing originals being continually added
			to the set list. <br>It's the type of show than can pull you out of a
			troubled state of mind and get you smiling and dancing the night
			away.</p>
		<p>They are headed up by Jonathan from Melbourne Australia, who
			infuses the band with a great philosophy and work ethic. <br>Jonathan has
			been blessed with a great group of like-minded musicians who are all
			accomplished in their art. <br>The jingles are great bunch of guys who
			all contribute to the songwriting process, and stage presence.</p>
		<p>Spending a lot of time hanging out with them, watching them
			rehearse, perform and get better I would bet they are going somewhere
			soon.</p>
		<p>They are presently in the competition for Estonian Eurovision and
			you can support them with that. <br><br>You should really check them out if
			you get the chance, I can personally vouch for them.</p>
		<p>Here's the latest video of them:</p>
