		<p>Gipper is an experienced, self-employed journalist new to the comedy
			section of the website. <br><br>Gipper, who was nameless until the age of 7,
			received the name from Ethiopian tribesmen who fostered him.</p>
		<p>
			'Gipper' means 'Man whose wit is Fucked' in Ethiopian. <br>Gipper was
			abandoned by his white parents who are presumed to be from either
			Canada or USA when they were on holiday in Ethiopia. <br><br>
			Unfortunately, Gipper does not know his surname so simply goes by
			Gipper.
		</p>
		<p>Gipper spent his time employed as a Faeces Sweep for his adopted
			Ethiopian Tribe before humanitarian efforts saw a family take him to
			Canada for a better life.</p>
		<p>

			After attending school in Canada and learning to write, tragically
			Gipper was violently raped by a Grizzly Bear whilst on a family
			picnic. <br><br>Gipper however, did not let life's little mishap deter
			him from his passion.
		</p>
		<p>

			He began to write news articles on the happenings in the medical ward he
			was hospitalised in. <br> Gipper wrote stories such as "87-year-old Man has both
			legs amputated" and "AIDs victim dies the slow and painful death"
			while recovering. <br><br>
			Gipper also founded the worlds first support group for animal rape survivors which
			currently has 3 members worldwide.
		</p>
		<p>

			Following discharge from hospital Gipper moved to New York and became
			homeless but still spent countless hours sending articles to the New
			York Times. <br><br>Unfortunately, at the time, he developed a chronic
			methylamphetamine habit.<br> <br> When Gipper sent the New York Times the
			40 0000 word article 'Sifting Through Rubbish-The Best Bins In New
			York For Goodies" he received this response from The New York Times.
		</p>
		<p><i>"Dear Gipper, we regret to advise that after receiving your countless
			letters, including this one particular, we have contacted Mental
			Health Authorities for your welfare and you will be sectioned under
			45 C of the United States Mental Health Act. Please do not send us
			any more of your letters and seek the treatment you clearly need ."</i></p>
		<p>

			Gippers journalism often covers taboo and confronting topics however
			he never holds back on the truth. <br> Gipper goes behind the scenes
			with stark and objective accounts of some of the most scandalous and
			controversial events and celebrity secrets.<br><br> He has strong ties to
			some of the most famous reporters in the world and is affectionately
			known as 'the fuckwit pest' of the journalist scene.
		</p>

		<p>Keep an eye out for his work I hope you enjoy it.</p>
