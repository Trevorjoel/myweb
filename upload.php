		<p>There are two different forms for those who want to upload their
			content. Both forms are shown below this instructional text.</p>

			out this form.</p>

		<p>a) Fill out your basic details and email in case we have any
			problems and we need to contact you.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			b) Fill out the title and text body.<br> You can choose to answer all
			the question fields so that we can write up an article for you or you
			can copy your entire article into the last text field, so long as all
			the basic information is provided. All the questions on the form can
			prompt you to write a clear and coherent article. <b>Please ensure
				the text has been proofread and ready to be posted to the site.</b>

		</p>
		<p>c) Include links to your website, facebook, twitter, skype and
			other contacts. We will create buttons so potential customers can

		<p>d) Upload images. We need pictures, logos etc, anything you would
			like us to use to create the image of your brand.</p>
