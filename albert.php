		<p>Albert "fingers" Phagtron is a freelance author who's articles will
			be featured in the comedy section of our website. <br>Albert "Fingers",
			as he is known by many law enforcement officials and after dark
			joggers, was born in Kentucky U.S.A on a chicken farm to Mary-Lou and
			Cleetus Phagtron. <br><br>Mary and Cleetus were well known around town for
			their Moonshine and Meth parties.<br> <br>Fingers's, talents were noticed at
			an early age when in school he was awarded a stern caning from the
			headmaster for writing "The headmaster is a fat child molester" in
			the toilet stall.</p>

		<p>After finishing High School, Albert moved to Hollywood where he
			began writing on many famous Californian landmarks and celebrities
			properties, even once scrawling "SLUT!" in his trademark writing
			style on Madonna's front gate. <br><br>After scratching artfully
			"CockMuncher, bum bandit" with a key, deep into the paint of Tom
			Cruise's newest BMW, Albert decided to take his writing skills
			abroad, to the birthplace of the English language to further hone his
			skills. <br><br>Albert learnt much living in a burnt out crackhouse ten
			kilometers from the prestigious Cambridge University, with works such
			as; "Wot' cunt keeps eating all my fucking food?" note left on the
			fridge for his junky housemates, Albert began to recognise his own
			literary genius.</p>

		<p>Exchanging hand jobs for transport at truck stops around the world
			Fingers has managed to travel around the globe and is now a freelance
			writer for many prestigious publications such as ours. <br><br>After
			submitting various articles to The New York Times, he received the
			following rave review:</p>
		<p>
			<i> "Dear Mr Phagtron,<br> please cease sending your drunken, insane trash
				to our editors. For your information, your works are literally as
				inviting as that of adrunken and deranged gorilla having an
				 epileptic fit on a keyboard then proceeding to wipe its ass on the page. <br>Should you not
				comply with our requests to cease and desist you shall find a
				restraining order put upon you".</i>--- Head of the legal division: NY
				Times
		</p>

		<p>Fingers writing is not for every reader, those who are easily
			offended should avoid his works like the plague, we are not
			responsible for anything he chooses to publish in our comedy section.
			So please take heed of our warning and take your complaints to
			someone who gives a shit.</p>

		<p>Keep an eye out for his work I hope you enjoy it.</p>
