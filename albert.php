        Location:<br>No fixed address</b>
  </p> <p>Albert "fingers" Phagtron is a freelance author who's articles will be featured in the comedy section of our website. Albert "Fingers", as he is known by many law enforcement officials and after dark joggers, was born in Kentucky U.S.A on a chicken farm to Mary-Lou and Cleetus Phagtron. Mary and Cleetus were well known around town for their Moonshine and Meth parties.
Fingers's, talents were noticed at an early age when in school he was awarded a stern caning from the headmaster for writing "The headmaster is a fat child molester" in the toilet stall. </p>

<p>After finishing High School, Albert moved to Hollywood where he began writing on many famous Californian landmarks and celebrities properties, even once scrawling "SLUT!" in his trademark writing style on Madonna's front gate. After scratching artfully "CockMuncher, bum bandit" with a key deep into the paint of Tom Cruise's newest BMW, Albert decided to take his writing skills abroad, to the birthplace of the English language to further hone his skills. Albert learnt much living in a burnt out crackhouse ten kilometers from the prestigious Cambridge University, with works such as; "Wot' cunt keeps eating all my fucking food?" note left on the fridge for his junky housemates Albert began to recognise his own literary genius.</p>

<p>Exchanging hand jobs for transport at truck stops around the world Fingers has managed to travel around the globe and is now a freelance writer for many prestigious publications such as ours. After submitting various articles to The New York Times, he received the following rave review:</p><p><i> "Dear Mr Phagtron please cease sending your drunken, insane trash to our editors. For your information, your works are literally as inviting as that of a deranged posse of drunken gorillas having a collective epileptic fit on a keyboard then proceeding to take a huge shit on the page and sending us the results. Should you not comply with our requests to cease and desist you shall find a restraining order put upon you".--- Head of the legal division: NY Times</i></p>
 
<p>Fingers writing is not for every reader, those who are easily offended should avoid his works like the plague, we are not responsible for anything he chooses to publish in our comedy section. So please take heed of our warning and take your complaints to someone who gives a shit.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy his work.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
