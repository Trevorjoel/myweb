  Born from the bunghole of an ostrich, I took my first trip to Mordor in my avian mothers womb. I was hooked on travel immediately. Since that trip I have loved travel like a meth fiend loves the glass pipe. A long time user of couchsurfing I have hosted many people and surfed somewhat around Brazil and Europe. As the creator of this website I'm hoping to provide my friends with a safer more tight knit travel community where people can meet verified friends to meet up and even host eachother. Currently in Moscow I would welcome anybody to message me on my <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/tgarrity">Facebook</A> get in touch with me for a coffee, to network and show you around.
