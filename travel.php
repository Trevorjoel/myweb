		Born from the bunghole of an ostrich, I took my first trip to Mordor
		in my avian mothers womb. I was hooked on travel immediately. Since
		that trip I have loved travel like a meth fiend loves the glass pipe.
		A long time user of couchsurfing I have hosted many people and surfed
		somewhat around Brazil and Europe. As the creator of this website I'm
		hoping to provide my friends with a safer more tight knit travel
		community where people can meet verified friends to meet up and even
		host eachother. Currently in Moscow I would welcome anybody to message
		me on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tgarrity">Facebook</a> get
		in touch with me for a coffee, to network and show you around.
